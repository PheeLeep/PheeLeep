### 'Yo! ðŸ‘‹

I'm PheeLeep! A nice but freak programmer. I'm creating programs as my hobby and for the lols. But I also create programs  as a contribution to help solve problems that is currently unsolved.

- Currently, I'm coding programs in C# and Visual Basic.NET. But C# is my favorite use of programming language.
- I'm currently learning in Python.
